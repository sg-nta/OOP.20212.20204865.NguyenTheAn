Question 1 : If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to
build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
ANSWER: No, as the two methods both take in one String argument, then JAVA cannot identify the argument belong to
which method. 
Question 2: Try to add a method addDigitalVideoDisc which allows to pass an arbitrary number of
arguments for dvd. Compared to an array parameter. What do you prefer in this case?
ANSWER: We cannot create function addDigitalVideoDisc which allows to pass an arbitrary number of argument for DVD
as in that case the new function can take in a list and it will overlap with our current method. In my opinion, I
prefer the old method which take in the array of DVDs, as we can keep track of the list of DVDs we add at each time 
as it is saved in the list.
