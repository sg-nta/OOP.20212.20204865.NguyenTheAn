Q1 : After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two objects still remain?
ANSWER: Java has heap memory and stack memory. When we create jungleDVD and cinderellaDVD objects, they
are saved in heap memory. When we call swap method, it create new variables o1,o2 in stack memory that point to
the objects in heap memory. In swap method, we use "=" to assign variables, and that just changes the variables
in the stack memory and doesn't affect objects in heap memory. So the titles remain unchange.
Q2: After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is the title of the JungleDVD changed? 
ANSWER: The setTitle method will directly modify the object in the heap memory. So the title of Jungle
will change to cinderella. After that, the method "dvd = new DigitalVideoDisc (oldTitle)" will create 
new DVD object in heap memory, and variable "dvd" in stack memory will now point to it. But it will not
change the DVD object "jungledvd" in the heap memory. So the title of jungledvd will still "cinderella"
